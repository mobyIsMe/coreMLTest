# CoreMLDemo
A demo for iOS machine learning framework : Core ML

Only Xcode9 and above are supported.

Model **Places205-GoogLeNet** comes from [Apple Machine Learning]
(https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/).

See more details about this demo in [Chinese](http://www.jianshu.com/p/ed8e76081cad).

If an error like `GoogLeNetPlaces.h not found` occurs when you run this demo, try to drag the mlmodel file into the project and check the option in Target Membership on the right.
It seems like a bug of Xcode 9 beta.
